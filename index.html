        <h2>Starting a New Chapter at 30</h2>

        <p>
            At 30 years old, I decided to take a leap of faith and pursue a career in web development.
            For years, I watched others build incredible websites and applications, wondering if it was
            too late to start. But one day, I realized that the best time to plant a tree was yesterday,
            and the second best time is today. I ran to my desktop, chose to focus on Front End
            development, and embarked on a journey that would change my life - "Front-End Engineer by
            WeAreEdit.io". Starting with HTML and CSS, I discovered that learning to code wasn't as
            intimidating as I thought. Every line of code I wrote brought me closer to understanding
            how the web truly works.
